# 🚩 Custom domain & Source code

## 🎨 Custom domain

If you wish to have your own domain for your transcripts, you must pay $5/month [(github.com/sponsors/Sayrix)](https://github.com/sponsors/Sayrix?frequency=recurring&sponsor=Sayrix). This will allow you to contribute to Sayrix projects, and you will benefit from several advantages such as the removal of ads, the removal of the "Powered by Ticket-Bot" footer, and many more.

## 📝 Source code

The source code of ticket.pm is private.
